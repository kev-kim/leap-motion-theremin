# Theremin using Leap Motion

This is a [theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) created with the Leap Motion sensor, an infrared camera that detects hand and finger movements. I created this instrument as a passion project and as a way to learn [ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/).

Contact me for a demo video.
